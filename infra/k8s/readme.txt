apiVersion: v1 
Set of the service that kubernetes containes like Pods, Deployment and Services
In Kubernetes, the "apiVersion" field is used to specify the version of the Kubernetes API that the YAML file conforms to. This field is required in all Kubernetes YAML files to ensure that the Kubernetes API can properly handle the resource defined in the file.

In the example you provided, the "apiVersion" is set to "v1". This version of the Kubernetes API is the original version of the Kubernetes API and is still widely used in Kubernetes today. It provides a basic set of resources and functionality for deploying and managing containerized applications.
Other versions of the Kubernetes API may offer additional features or support for specific types of resources. For example, the "apps/v1" API version provides additional resources and functionality for managing Kubernetes Deployments, StatefulSets, and other workload controllers.

When creating YAML files for Kubernetes resources, it's important to ensure that the "apiVersion" field is set correctly to match the version of the Kubernetes API that your cluster is running. This helps ensure that your resources can be properly created, updated, and managed by Kubernetes.
